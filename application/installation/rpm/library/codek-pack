    # Description  : LibMPEG3 decodes the many many derivatives of MPEG standards into
    # : uncompressed data suitable for editing and playback.
    # :
    # : libmpeg3 currently decodes:
    # :  - MPEG-1 Layer II/III Audio and program streams

    # Summary      : Libraries for the mp3Splt project
    # URL          : http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/
    # Лицензия     : GPLv2
    # Description  : The mp3Splt project provides utilities to split mp3 and ogg files,
    # : by selecting a begin and an end time position, without decoding.
    # : It is very useful to split large mp3/ogg into smaller files,
    # : or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks.
    # : To split an album, the split points and filenames can be selected
    # : manually or automatically from CDDB (internet or a local file),
    # : or from .cue files.
    # :
    # : It supports automatic silence detection, which can be used
    # : to adjust cddb/cue split points. It is also possible to extract
    # : tracks from Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap files in a few seconds.
    # :
    # : The mp3splt project is divided in 3 parts:
    # : libmp3splt, mp3splt and mp3splt-gtk.

    # Description  : The libmp4v2 library provides an abstraction layer for working with files

    # Лицензия     : BSD
    # Description  : Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high quality.
    # : It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that you won't be
    # : able to hear differences between the original wave file and the much smaller
    # : MPC file.
    # : It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but has rapidly developed
    # : and vastly improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it contains
    # : heavily optimized and patentless code.
