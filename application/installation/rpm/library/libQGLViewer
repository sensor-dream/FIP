    # Описание     : libQGLViewer is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the creation of OpenGL
    # : 3D viewers. It provides some of the typical 3D viewer functionality, such
    # : as the possibility to move the camera using the mouse, which lacks in most
    # : of the other APIs. Other features include mouse manipulated frames,
    # : interpolated key-frames, object selection, stereo display, screenshot saving
    # : and much more. It can be used by OpenGL beginners as well as to create
    # : complex applications, being fully customizable and easy to extend.
